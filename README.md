A Zen Browser theme that implements a clean, minimalist New Tab page

## Features
- Enlarges the Zen logo
- Adds a simple animation for the Zen logo when the page loads
- Hides the search bar
- Hides the customize button

## Important Things to Note
This theme <u>does</u> in fact remove the search bar. This may cause issues in some cases:
- if the user clicks the "New Tab" button or Control/Command + T, then starts typing the URL, everything will function normally
- However, if they click away after opening the new tab, they will not be able to "just start typing" a URL, as the search functionality is no longer selected. Two solutions present themselves:
    1. Manually click the URL bar in the sidebar
    2. Press Control/Command + T again to open a another New Tab, then start typing
- If this bothers you, accept my deepest apologies; there isn't really a good fix right now (since I can't inject JavaScript into the browser) besides just adding the search bar back. But then there isn't really much use of the theme, which aims for a clean New Tab.
